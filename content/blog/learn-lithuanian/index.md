LearnLithuanian was a small market research project I did when I was trying to figure
out what to build. At that time I was trying to find resources to learn the language,
given that my wife was born there- but was quite hard to find anything useful. You see,
Lithuanian has a very complex grammar system in which for example: depending of the noun
behind a word the ending of the following word needs to change accordingly. Also add up
other rules for different endings and scenarios and verbs.. and you see how this is getting
hard to grasp already.

I did a bit of research into other platforms that provide what I was after but had
little to no success.  My aim was to find something like Duolingo, but tailored to
Lithuanian. Sadly they still don't have any courses for this language and seems like
they are not planning to have it anytime soon. A few other apps here and there I found,
but were very basic or just literally a list of sentences translated to English.

Upon realizing there wasn't anything up to the standards I was after, I decided to
create a simple landing page that was deployed to firebase and used a simple firebase
database to store signups there. In the landing page I just described what the app was,
what features had, and explained that while I was still building it I was planning on
releasing it soon. With the hopes obviously, that people would signup anyway to know
when it's out in the market.

So once that was done it was time to find my target audience to advertise the small lading
page. I quickly found out that there was *a lot* of Lithuanian migrants and expats living
in the US, mostly people who left escaping the Soviet Union or WWII and were now
living there with their children. And since their children grew up as Americans most of
them dont speak Lithuanian at all, so that's it! My target audience was mostly parents
of Lithuanian decendants living in the US that have kids or couples in which one of the parts
wants to learn the language of the other (such as myself).

I found a few facebook groups of lithuanians living in the US, another one of Lithuanians
living in the UK, a few reddit groups here and there and a bunch of Duoling forum posts
of people asking when they were going to add Lithuanian to their app. Upon the timespan of
a month I got about 850+ signups and a bunch of messages and emails from people really
looking forward to the launch.

But given
