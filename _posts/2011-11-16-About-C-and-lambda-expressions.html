title: About C# and lambda expressions.
categories: .NET

<p>The Lambda Expressions, included in C# 3.0, are anonymous functions that can contain expressions and instructions and can be used to create delegates or expression tree types. These provide us the ability to compile them as expression trees, ie data objects in memory representing the algorithm for evaluating the lambda expression itself.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see a little example:</p>

<pre>
	    class Program
      {
          static Func<double, double, double> makeSomething = (x, y) => Math.Sqrt(x + y);
          static Expression<Func<double, double, double >> makeSomethingExpression = (x, y) => Math.Sqrt(x + y);
      
          static void Main(string[] args)
          {
              Console.WriteLine(makeSomethingExpression);
              
              // Generamos ILAsm
              makeSomething = makeSomethingExpression.Compile();
              
              Console.WriteLine("makeSomething(12, 4) = " + makeSomething(12, 4));
              
              Console.ReadLine();
          }
      }
</pre>

<p>This code is generated for the object tree that represents the sequence of actions necessary for the evaluation of the tree structure generated. Note that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb335710.aspx">Expression</a> class provides a method Compile(), with which we can dynamically generate executable code for that expression when we want.</p>
<p>You can read a little more of lambda expressions in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/es-es/library/bb397687.aspx">msdn</a>, in <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/explore_lamda_exp.aspx">Code Project</a> or watch a few <a href="http://flash.timrayburn.net/introtocsharp3/">screencast</a>.</p>
